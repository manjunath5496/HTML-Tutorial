<h2 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">HTML</h2>
<p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>HTML</strong>) is the standard&nbsp;<a title="Markup language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a>&nbsp;for documents designed to be displayed in a&nbsp;<a title="Web browser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>. It can be assisted by technologies such as&nbsp;<a title="Cascading Style Sheets" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a>&nbsp;(CSS) and&nbsp;<a title="Scripting language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting languages</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a title="JavaScript" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Web browser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a>&nbsp;receive HTML documents from a&nbsp;<a title="Web server" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a>&nbsp;or from local storage and&nbsp;<a title="Browser engine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine">render</a>&nbsp;the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page&nbsp;<a title="Semantic Web" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantically</a>&nbsp;and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<p><a title="HTML element" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a>&nbsp;are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,&nbsp;<a title="HTML element" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Images_and_objects">images</a>&nbsp;and other objects such as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Fieldset" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldset">interactive forms</a>&nbsp;may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create&nbsp;<a title="Structured document" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document">structured documents</a>&nbsp;by denoting structural&nbsp;<a title="Semantics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a>&nbsp;for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,&nbsp;<a title="Hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a>, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by&nbsp;<em>tags</em>, written using&nbsp;<a title="Bracket" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as&nbsp;<code id="" class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span>&nbsp;<span class="p">/&gt;</span></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code id="" class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span>&nbsp;<span class="p">/&gt;</span></code>&nbsp;directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as&nbsp;<code id="" class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code>&nbsp;surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
<p>HTML can embed programs written in a&nbsp;<a title="Scripting language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting language</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a title="JavaScript" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The&nbsp;<a title="World Wide Web Consortium" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a>&nbsp;(W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In 1980, physicist&nbsp;<a title="Tim Berners-Lee" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at&nbsp;<a title="CERN" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped&nbsp;<a title="ENQUIRE" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an&nbsp;<a title="Internet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based&nbsp;<a title="Hypertext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>&nbsp;system.&nbsp;Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer&nbsp;<a title="Robert Cailliau" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a>&nbsp;collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes&nbsp;from 1990 he listed&nbsp;"some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called&nbsp;<a class="external text" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html" rel="nofollow">"HTML Tags"</a>, first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.&nbsp;It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by&nbsp;<a title="SGMLguid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGMLguid">SGMLguid</a>, an in-house&nbsp;<a title="Standard Generalized Markup Language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard Generalized Markup Language</a>&nbsp;(SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>
<p>HTML is a&nbsp;<a title="Markup language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a title="Web browser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a>&nbsp;use to interpret and&nbsp;<a title="Typesetting" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting">compose</a>&nbsp;text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of&nbsp;<a title="Cascading Style Sheets" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537&nbsp;<em>Techniques for using SGML</em>, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the&nbsp;<a title="TYPSET and RUNOFF" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a>&nbsp;developed in the early 1960s for the&nbsp;<a title="Compatible Time-Sharing System" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a>&nbsp;(Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
<p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the&nbsp;<a title="Internet Engineering Task Force" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>&nbsp;(IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and&nbsp;<a title="Dan Connolly (computer scientist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an SGML&nbsp;<a title="Document type definition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document type definition</a>&nbsp;to define the grammar.&nbsp;The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the&nbsp;<a title="Mosaic (web browser)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA Mosaic</a>&nbsp;browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly,&nbsp;<a title="Dave Raggett" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.</p>
<p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.</p>
<p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996,&nbsp;the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the&nbsp;<a title="World Wide Web Consortium" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a>&nbsp;(W3C).&nbsp;However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (<a title="International Organization for Standardization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO</a>/<a title="International Electrotechnical Commission" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission">IEC</a>&nbsp;15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a>&nbsp;(WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</p>

<dd>HTML 3.0&nbsp;was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)&nbsp;without further action.

The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.&nbsp;Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."&nbsp;Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."</dd>

<dt><strong>2011&nbsp;HTML5 &ndash; Last Call</strong></dt>
<dd>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.&nbsp;In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.</dd>
<dt><strong>2012&nbsp;HTML5 &ndash; Candidate Recommendation</strong></dt>
<dd>In July 2012, WHATWG and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="W3C" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a>&nbsp;decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.</dd>
<dd>In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.&nbsp;The criterion for advancement to&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="W3C recommendation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_recommendation#W3C_Recommendation_(REC)">W3C Recommendation</a>&nbsp;is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".</dd>

<h4><span id="XHTML_versions" class="mw-headline">XHTML versions</span></h4>
<p>XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using&nbsp;<a title="XML" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>&nbsp;1.0. It is no longer being developed as a separate standard.</p>
<ul>
<li>XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,&nbsp;and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.</li>
<li>XHTML 1.1&nbsp;was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001.</li>
<li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on&nbsp;<a title="HTML5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="XHTML" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML#XHTML5">XHTML5</a>.&nbsp;XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>
<li>An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside&nbsp;<a title="HTML5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>&nbsp;in the HTML5 draft.</li>

<h3><span id="Transition_of_HTML_Publication_to_WHATWG" class="mw-headline">Transition of HTML Publication to WHATWG</span></h3>
<p>On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.&nbsp;The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.&nbsp;The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the de facto web standard for some time.</p>
